I am teaching a class on advanced web development.  The next assignment is to tell a story.

The included markdown file is of the requirements, and story telling information. 

# Individual Assignment

The individual assignment is to write a story using the story arch of their choosing, and for each of the steps draw a picture of the story point.

# The team asssignment

The team project will need to be hosted on www.uvucs.org, and retreive it's data from data.uvucs.org, and run it's orcestration on the mqtt broker at: mqtt.uvucs.org.  

Hosting will involve building a zip file with the content, and uploading it to the www server for hosting. 


Using this information, write up the assignments, one for the individual, and one for the team, and include the grading for the individual assignment, and a rubrick.  For the team assignment, include a presentation breakdown, that includes the following: Grading for how AI was used, what technology was used, and demo, each representin 1/3 of the grade.
