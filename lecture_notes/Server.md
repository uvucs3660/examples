# Servers

## URL's

## Basic HTTP Request:

[Basic HTTP Request](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7880fc22-160a-4d20-9e74-00f9ded06681_1600x938.png)

## URL Components

Lets Talk about Hosts

DNS turns a domain name into an IP address, the systems don't use the names, but use the ip addresses for communication, after DNS

commands like ping let you put in a domain name, and get it's ip address.

## Demo - Ping

```
dig uvu.edu
```

```
ping localhost
```

Localhost is used to send a loopback request, which is data from your computer acting as a virtual server, and is sent back to itself without ever passing through a physical network.

This bypasses any local network interface hardware

## Ports

How many ports are the: 2^16 or 65536

0 is reserved and implies an unspecified source or destination

[IP Ports and their assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)

\< 1024 are "priveleged ports" and require specific permission to access

We will generally use ports over 1024 for our projects. Â The rest of the ports can be used as long as someone isn't using it first, but you can always lookup and see who might be using them

## Demo -

show telnet accessing content on local web server

show postman making data save and load requests.
